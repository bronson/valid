Unfortunately node-validator needs to run immediately.  You can't
declare the validations that will be run later.

The syntax is pretty sweet: check('abc').len(6,12).isEmail();

Why didn't I see this one first???  It's not bad.
Doesn't allow static schemas ({12} doesn't work, must use {__.eq(12)
Doesn't deeply nest schemas well.
Don't like the error messages.
Minor downside: uses underscore.
